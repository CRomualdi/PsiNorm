Description: The function first computes the cell specific shape parameter a of the Pareto distribution and then normalize the samples with it. By maximum likelihood method it estimates the parameter a equal to the log geometric mean of the pseudo-sample.  The Pareto parameter is inversely proportional to the sequencing depth, it is sample specific and its estimate is performed for each cell independently. The normalized counts are equal to log2(ax+1) where x is each cell sample.
